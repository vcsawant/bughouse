# Bughouse Chess Web Application

A real-time, multiplayer Bughouse chess platform built with Phoenix LiveView and Elixir.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Bughouse is a popular chess variant played by four players in two teams of two. This project aims to create the premier online platform for playing Bughouse chess, offering a seamless real-time experience with robust game tracking, social features, and eventually AI opponents.

**Target Audience:** Chess enthusiasts, competitive Bughouse players, and casual gamers looking for a fast-paced chess variant.

**Core Philosophy:** 
- Real-time gameplay with minimal latency
- Clean, intuitive user interface
- Fault-tolerant (handle disconnections gracefully)
- Free to play, community-focused

## 🎮 What is Bughouse?

Bughouse (also known as "Siamese Chess" or "Transfer Chess") is a fast-paced chess variant with these key rules:

- **4 Players, 2 Teams:** Players are paired into teams sitting opposite each other
- **2 Simultaneous Boards:** Each player plays their own game of chess
- **Piece Transfer:** When you capture a piece on your board, it becomes available for your teammate to place on their board
- **Drop Mechanic:** Players can use their turn to place a captured piece anywhere on their board (with restrictions)
- **Speed:** Typically played with short time controls (3-5 minutes per player)
- **Team Victory:** If either player on a team gets checkmated or runs out of time, their entire team loses

This creates a unique dynamic where players must balance their own game while coordinating piece transfers with their partner.

### Key UI Elements

**Chess Board:**
- 8x8 grid with alternating light (#f0d9b5) and dark (#b58863) squares
- Unicode chess pieces (♔♕♖♗♘♙ / ♚♛♜♝♞♟)
- File labels (a-h) on bottom
- Rank labels (1-8) on left side
- Highlighted selected piece
- Highlighted valid move destinations
- Move animation (smooth piece movement)

**Captured Pieces Display:**
- Grouped by type
- Count badge for multiple pieces of same type
- Clickable to select for drop
- Visual indicator when piece selected

**Chess Clocks:**
- MM:SS format
- Active player's clock highlighted
- Red when <30 seconds remain
- Pulses when <10 seconds

**Game Lobby:**
- 4 player slots in a 2x2 grid
- Team indicators (Team White vs Team Black)
- "Open" button for empty slots
- Player names when filled
- "Start Game" button (enabled when 4 players)
- Shareable invite link prominently displayed

---

## 🔄 Real-Time Synchronization

### PubSub Topics

**Game Updates:**
```elixir
topic: "game:#{game_id}"
events: 
  - player_joined
  - player_left
  - move_made
  - piece_dropped
  - time_updated
  - game_ended
```

**Lobby Updates:**
```elixir
topic: "lobby:#{game_id}"
events:
  - slot_filled
  - slot_emptied
  - game_started
```

### State Management

- **Source of truth:** PostgreSQL database
- **In-memory cache:** LiveView assigns (per-connection state)
- **Broadcast:** PubSub for cross-player synchronization
- **Persistence:** Save to DB after each move/drop

### Connection Handling

1. **On Connect:** Load game state from DB
2. **On Move:** Validate → Save → Broadcast → Update all clients
3. **On Disconnect:** Mark player as disconnected, continue game
4. **On Reconnect:** Restore player position, sync current state

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage Goals

- **Business Logic:** >80% coverage
- **LiveView Interactions:** Key user flows tested
- **Chess Engine:** 100% coverage (move validation critical)

### Test Types

**Unit Tests:**
- Chess move validation
- Board state transformations
- Bughouse piece transfer logic
- Win condition detection
- Time management

**Integration Tests:**
- Game creation flow
- Player join/leave
- Full game playthrough
- Reconnection scenarios

**LiveView Tests:**
- Lobby interactions
- Move input handling
- Real-time updates
- Error handling

### Test Data

Use ExMachina for factories:
- Standard chess positions
- Common bughouse scenarios
- Edge cases (castling, en passant, promotion)
- Checkmate patterns

---

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### Environments

**Development:**
- Local PostgreSQL
- Local Phoenix server
- Hot code reloading enabled

**Production:**
- Fly.io hosting (single US region)
- Fly.io managed PostgreSQL
- SSL via Fly.io
- Custom domain

### Deployment Process

```bash
# 1. Run tests
mix test

# 2. Build release
MIX_ENV=prod mix release

# 3. Deploy to Fly.io
fly deploy

# 4. Run migrations
fly ssh console -C "/app/bin/migrate"
```

### Monitoring

- Fly.io metrics dashboard
- Phoenix LiveDashboard (production)
- Error tracking via Logger
- (Future: Sentry/AppSignal integration)

### Backup Strategy

- Automatic daily PostgreSQL backups (Fly.io)
- 7-day retention
- Manual backup before major deployments

---

## 📈 Scalability Considerations

### Current Scale (Phase 1)

**Target:** 10-50 concurrent games (40-200 connected users)

**Infrastructure:**
- Single Fly.io VM (shared CPU)
- 1GB RAM
- Shared PostgreSQL instance

**Expected Performance:**
- <100ms move latency
- <50ms LiveView updates
- Handles 200+ WebSocket connections easily

### Future Scale (If Needed)

**1,000+ concurrent games:**
- Vertical scaling: Dedicated CPU, 2-4GB RAM
- Horizontal scaling: Multiple Fly.io instances
- PostgreSQL read replicas
- Redis for session store
- CDN for static assets

**Phoenix handles this well:**
- 2 million WebSocket connections per server (proven)
- Sub-millisecond message passing (BEAM VM)
- Built-in distributed system capabilities

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Authentication

- Bcrypt password hashing (cost: 12)
- Secure session tokens
- CSRF protection (built into Phoenix)
- Rate limiting on login attempts (future)

### Authorization

- Users can only modify their own games
- Guest players assigned via session ID
- No direct database ID exposure (use UUIDs)

### Data Protection

- Passwords never stored in plain text
- User emails not publicly exposed
- Game history private by default

### Input Validation

- All moves validated server-side
- No trust in client-side state
- SQL injection prevention (Ecto)
- XSS prevention (Phoenix templates escape by default)

---

## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Elixir 1.14+ 
- Erlang/OTP 25+

mix deps.get
npm install --prefix assets

# Create database
mix ecto.create
mix ecto.migrate

# Start Phoenix server
mix phx.server
```

Visit `http://localhost:4000`

### Configuration

Create `config/dev.secret.exs` (gitignored):

```elixir
import Config

config :bughouse, Bughouse.Repo,
  username: "YOUR_USERNAME",
  password: "",
  hostname: "localhost",
  database: "bughouse_dev"
```
